# STM32-Tracking-Device
This repo contains the source code for my undergraduate project.
Code is written for stm32h7xx development boards.
The project itself is a Tracking Device, which offers the opportunity for the user to track the positioning and control remotely some specific features of the monitorized vehicle.
These features include the heating system simulated by a 12V DC Fan, the exterior lights(lowbeam,highbeam,position lights), aswell as the door locking system simulated by two servo motors.
The remote control is possible from a mobile application and it's conditioned by the presence of the driver. The initial commit contains just the source code for the STM32.
The final version of the project is made of a 3D modell which simulates the dashboard of a car, with some knobs, buttons and switches to control locally the features specified earlier and a 3.5" TFT LCD display to show some user relevant informations.
If needed, more informations can be provided about the project, including a PowerPoint presentation, demo video, mobile application source code, known problems and limitations etc.
